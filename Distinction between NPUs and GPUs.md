# Distinction between NPUs and GPUs 

|Processor Type|Concepts|Features|
|-|-|-|
|NPUs|**Specialization for AI Inference**|**Inference Efficiency**: NPUs are designed to accelerate specific neural network operations, making them highly efficient for running trained models (inference) with lower power consumption.|
|||**Potential for Generative AI Inference**: While NPUs can be used for inference in generative AI, they might not yet be as optimized for the highly complex and variable nature of generative models as GPUs. However, advancements are continually being made.|
|GPUs|**Broad AI Applications Including Generative AI**|**Training Powerhouse**: GPUs excel in the training of generative models due to their ability to handle extensive parallel computations required by large datasets and complex models.|
|||**Inference Versatility**: GPUs are also effective for inference, including for generative models, where the computational demands can be high.|
|||**Generative AI Optimization**: The extensive software support and libraries available for GPUs make them a preferred choice for developing and deploying generative AI applications.|

## Build and deploy an AI model

|Stage|Process|
|-|-|
|**Data Collection**|This is the process of gathering relevant data from various sources. It's crucial to have high-quality and representative data to train a machine learning model effectively.|
|**Training**|In this step, the collected data is used to train a machine learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships from the data during this training phase.|
|**Conversion**|Once the model is trained, it often needs to be converted into a format suitable for deployment on the target platform. This might involve converting it to a more efficient runtime format or optimizing it for inference speed.|
|**Inferencing**|This is the stage where the trained model is used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. Inferencing involves feeding new data into the trained model and obtaining predictions or classifications based on the learned patterns.|
|**Deployment**|After the model has been trained and converted (if necessary), it's deployed into production where it can be used to make real-world predictions or decisions. Deployment involves integrating the model into the target environment, whether that's a web application, a mobile app, an IoT device, or some other system.|
