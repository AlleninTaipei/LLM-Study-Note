### The process of changing the GGUF file during fine-tuning

* Load the original GGUF file.
* Extract the model architecture and initial weights.
* Perform fine-tuning using new data: This involves forward passes, calculating loss, and backpropagation. Gradients are computed and applied to update the weights.
* Update the weights in the GGUF structure.
* Modify relevant metadata.
* Save the updated model back into the GGUF format.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, TrainingArguments, Trainer
from peft import prepare_model_for_kbit_training, LoraConfig, get_peft_model

# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, load_in_4bit=True, device_map="auto")

# Prepare the model for k-bit training
model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)

# Configure LoRA
peft_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,
    lora_alpha=32,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],
    lora_dropout=0.05,
    bias="none",
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM"
)

# Apply LoRA to the model
model = get_peft_model(model, peft_config)

# Load and preprocess the dataset
dataset = load_dataset("imdb")

def preprocess_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], truncation=True, max_length=512)

tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)

# Set up training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="./logs",
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset["test"],
)

# Start fine-tuning
trainer.train()

# Save the fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
```

### Real-world purpose of fine-tuning

Fine-tuning is done to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task or domain, improving its performance on that particular application while leveraging its general knowledge.

### Example 1

Let's say we have a large language model trained on general web data, and we want to use it for medical question answering.

#### Before fine-tuning

The model has broad knowledge but might struggle with specific medical terminology or the latest treatment protocols. It could give general answers but might lack precision in medical contexts.

```plaintext
User: "What are the symptoms of acute appendicitis?"
Response: "Acute appendicitis can cause abdominal pain and fever. It's a serious condition that may require medical attention."
```

#### After fine-tuning on medical literature and Q&A datasets

Improved medical accuracy: The model would provide more precise, up-to-date medical information.

```plaintext
User: "What are the symptoms of acute appendicitis?"
Response: "Common symptoms of acute appendicitis include: 
Sudden pain that begins on the right side of the lower abdomen
Pain that worsens if you cough, walk or make other jarring movements
Nausea and vomiting
Loss of appetite
Low-grade fever that may worsen as the illness progresses
Constipation or diarrhea
Abdominal bloating
If you experience these symptoms, especially severe abdominal pain, seek immediate medical attention."
```
* Better understanding of medical context: The model would better interpret medical jargon and provide more relevant answers.
* Up-to-date information: If fine-tuned on recent medical literature, it could incorporate the latest research and guidelines.
* Improved medical reasoning: The model might better connect symptoms to potential diagnoses or suggest appropriate next steps.
* Domain-specific language: It would use more appropriate medical terminology and phrasing.
* Reduced hallucinations on medical topics: The model would be less likely to generate false or misleading medical information.

* Expected behavior changes:
  * More accurate and detailed responses to medical queries
  * Better handling of medical terminology
  * Improved ability to provide relevant medical advice (with appropriate disclaimers)
  * Potentially faster and more confident responses on medical topics

This example demonstrates how fine-tuning can significantly enhance a model's performance in a specific domain, making it much more useful for specialized applications like medical Q&A. The same principle applies to other domains - legal, financial, technical support, etc. - where adapting a general model to specific knowledge and language can greatly improve its practical utility.

### Example 2

Scenario: You have a pre-trained LLaMA model stored in a GGUF file, and you want to fine-tune it for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The fine-tuning will involve training the model on a new dataset that includes labeled movie reviews as positive or negative.

#### 1. Original Model Setup

* Model Name: LLaMA-2B
* GGUF File: llama-2b.gguf
* Vocabulary: Contains standard tokens, e.g., ["the", "movie", "was", "good", "bad", ...]
* Model Parameters: Weights and biases for the transformer layers.

#### 2. Prepare Fine-Tuning Data

* Dataset: A collection of 50,000 movie reviews, each labeled as positive or negative.
* New Tokens: The dataset introduces a few new tokens like “cinematography”, which weren’t in the original vocabulary.

#### 3. Fine-Tuning Process

* Training: You fine-tune the model using this dataset. 
* During fine-tuning: 
  * The model’s weights are adjusted based on the new data.
  * The vocabulary is expanded to include the new token “cinematography”.
  * A new output layer might be added for binary classification (positive/negative sentiment).

#### 4. Changes to the Model:

* Updated Weights: The weights in the transformer layers are adjusted.
* Expanded Vocabulary: The vocabulary now includes the new token “cinematography”, and its embedding is initialized and fine-tuned.
* New Classification Layer: A new linear layer is added to map the model’s output to two classes (positive and negative).

#### 5. Update the GGUF File

|Update the GGUF File|Notes|
|-|-|
|**Update Model Parameters**|The updated weights and biases are serialized into the GGUF file. The new classification layer’s weights are also added.|
|**Update Vocabulary and Embeddings**|The new token “cinematography” is added to the vocabulary section. A new embedding vector corresponding to this token is included.|
|**Rebuild GGUF File**|The GGUF file is rebuilt with the new parameters and vocabulary.|
|**The metadata is updated to reflect the fine-tuning process**|Fine-Tuning Dataset: "Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis Dataset"|
||Date of Fine-Tuning: "2024-08-23"|
||Task: Sentiment Analysis|
||Special Tokens: Added “cinematography”.|
||Recalculate Checksums: A new checksum is calculated to ensure the file’s integrity after the updates.|
|**Save the New GGUF File**|The new file is saved as llama-2b-sentiment.gguf.|

#### 6. Using the Fine-Tuned Model

* Deployment: The fine-tuned GGUF file llama-2b-sentiment.gguf is now ready for deployment.
* Inference: You can load this model and use it to classify new movie reviews as positive or negative.

In this example, you start with a pre-trained LLaMA model in a GGUF file. After fine-tuning the model on a new dataset for sentiment analysis, the GGUF file is updated to reflect the changes in model weights, vocabulary, and structure. The fine-tuned GGUF file is then ready for deployment, enabling the model to perform the new task effectively. This simple example illustrates how fine-tuning affects the model and its GGUF representation.

## Get to know Dataset in Parquet Files

[H2O LLM Studio](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-llmstudio) - A framework and no-code GUI designed for fine-tuning state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs).

I found two files, `train.pq` and `train_full.pq`, when Ielected the Datasets function and chose the View Datasets option.

### Parquet vs CSV

The choice between Parquet and CSV is contingent on the specific requirements, use cases, and the tools or frameworks used for data processing and analysis.

|Key Factors|Parquet|CSV|
|-|-|-|
|Storage Efficiency|**columnar storage layout offers superior storage efficiency due to its advanced encoding schemes and compression techniques, significantly reducing the storage footprint**|traditional row-based format|
|Performance|**selectively reads relevant data for analytical queries, skipping the rest, which leads to a substantial increase in processing speed**|necessitate the reading of entire rows, even when only a subset of columns is required|
|Data Types and Schema Evolution|It's adept at handling complex and nested data structures, making it ideal for structured and semi-structured data. It also supports schema evolution, facilitating the addition of new columns to existing Parquet files without necessitating a complete dataset rewrite.|It's limited to a flat, tabular format and lacks built-in support for complex data types or schema evolution.|
|Interoperability|Not directly readable by humans, are compatible with a plethora of data processing frameworks and tools that support the Parquet format, such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Apache Arrow.|**CSV files are universally compatible and can be easily manipulated using standard text editors or spreadsheet software.**|
|Serialization and Data Compression|**column-level compression techniques which significantly reduces file sizes and enhancing I/O performance**|**However, the compression and serialization overhead may be lower for CSV compared to Parquet.**|
|Schema Flexibility|Parquet benefits from a defined schema, ensuring data consistency and enabling more efficient compression and query optimization.|It does not enforce a strict schema, providing flexibility in terms of column quantity and types.|
|Column Pruning|Columnar format allows for column pruning, a significant performance enhancement that isn't possible with row-based formats like CSV.||
|Popularity|Parquet has gained substantial traction outside the Hadoop ecosystem, with projects like Delta Lake being built on Parquet files. While Avro is popular within the Hadoop ecosystem, it lacks built-in readers in Spark and Pandas.||
|Schema Storage|Parquet stores the file schema in the file metadata, eliminating the need for supplying or inferring the schema, which can be tedious or error-prone.||
|Column Metadata|Parquet stores metadata statistics for each column and allows users to add their own column metadata. This feature enables Parquet predicate pushdown filtering, which is supported by Dask & Spark cluster computing frameworks.||
|Complex Column Types|Parquet supports complex column types like arrays, dictionaries, and nested schemas, which cannot be reliably stored in simple file formats like CSV.||
|Immutability|Parquet files are immutable This characteristic means that while it's easy to add a row to a CSV file, it's not as straightforward with a Parquet file.||
|Data Lakes|In a big data environment, optimal disk layout of data is crucial. Parquet's ability to work with hundreds or thousands of files, disk partitioning, and compacting small files makes it an ideal choice for data lakes.||
|Conclusion|**Parquet is typically favored when dealing with large datasets, analytical workloads, and complex data types, as it provides superior storage efficiency and query performance.**|CSV files are typically used for simpler tabular data, data interchange, and scenarios where human readability and ease of use are paramount.|

|Encoding methods|Parquet data can be compressed|
|-|-|
|Dictionary encoding|This is enabled automatically and dynamically for data with a small number of unique values.|
|Bit packing|Storage of integers is usually done with dedicated 32 or 64 bits per integer. This allows more efficient storage of small integers.|
|Run length encoding (RLE)|When the same value occurs multiple times, a single value is stored once along with the number of occurrences. Parquet implements a combined version of bit packing and RLE, in which the encoding switches based on which produces the best compression results.|

### Python code to view Parquet and CSV Files

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file
df_csv = pd.read_csv('__meta_info__train.pq.csv')

# Display the contents
print(df_csv)

# Read the CSV file
df_csv = pd.read_csv('__meta_info__train_full.pq.csv')

# Display the contents
print(df_csv)

# Read the Parquet file
df_parquet = pd.read_parquet('train.pq')

# Display the contents
print(df_parquet)

# Read the Parquet file
df_parquet = pd.read_parquet('train_full.pq')

### Understanding and Viewing Training Data for DPO and Causal Language Modeling in LLM Fine-Tuning

|DPO Modeling (Distillation for Preference Optimization)|Causal Language Modeling|
|-|-|
|DPO is a training technique often used to fine-tune models based on user preferences or predefined criteria. In the context of train.pq, this method could involve the following steps:|Causal Language Modeling is a technique used to train language models to predict the next word in a sequence, given the previous words. This method ensures that the model learns the structure and context of language in a way that mimics how humans read or generate text. In the context of train_full.pq, this approach involves:|
|Distillation: The process of training a smaller or more efficient model to mimic the behavior of a larger, more complex model. This smaller model is "distilled" from the larger one by training it on the outputs of the larger model, potentially improving efficiency and performance.|Autoregressive Modeling: The model predicts the next word in a sequence based on the previous words. This is typically done in a left-to-right fashion, meaning the model generates one word at a time, conditioned on all previous words.|
|Preference Optimization: Fine-tuning the model to optimize for certain preferences, which could be based on user feedback, predefined rules, or specific goals. This ensures that the model generates outputs that are more aligned with desired outcomes.|Causal Relationships: The model learns the causal relationships between words, phrases, and sentences. This helps in generating coherent and contextually appropriate text.|

### Application to the example files

|train.pq (DPO Modeling)|train_full.pq (Causal Language Modeling)|
|-|-|
|This file likely contains training data designed to optimize the model based on specific preferences. The data includes scenarios where the model is expected to choose the "chosen" responses over the "rejected" ones.This approach fine-tunes the model to perform better on tasks where certain responses are preferred, based on the training examples.|This file contains data for training the model to predict the next word or sequence of words in a given context. The data includes instructions and corresponding outputs, which help the model learn to generate contextually relevant text. This approach is fundamental for tasks like text completion, dialogue generation, and other applications where understanding the flow of language is crucial.|
|system: Context or instruction for the AI assistant.|instruction: Specific instruction or query.|
|question: Task or question presented.|output: Response generated by the AI.|
|chosen: Expected or correct response.|id: Unique identifier for the interaction.|
|rejected: Incorrect or less preferred responses.|parent_id: Identifier linking the response to a previous interaction, if applicable.|

### Summary

|DPO Modeling|Causal Language Modeling|
|-|-|
|Used for optimizing models based on user preferences or specific criteria. Applied to train.pq, it involves fine-tuning the model to choose preferred responses.|Used for training models to predict the next word in a sequence, learning the causal relationships in language. Applied to train_full.pq, it helps the model generate coherent and contextually appropriate text.|

|Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)|Open Assistant (OASST)|
|-|-|
|DPO is a technique used in machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning and recommendation systems, to optimize a model based on direct user preferences or feedback. Instead of relying solely on implicit signals or indirect metrics, DPO uses explicit user preferences to guide the training process. This can lead to more accurate and user-centric models, as the optimization process directly aligns with what users prefer or find valuable.|OASST is an open-source project aimed at creating a high-quality, free, and accessible conversational AI. The goal of OASST is to develop an assistant that can engage in natural, informative, and helpful conversations with users. By being open-source, OASST encourages collaboration and contributions from the global community, promoting transparency, innovation, and inclusivity in the development of conversational AI technologies.|

Open Assistant (OASST) is broader in scope. It's an open-source project aimed at creating advanced conversational AI systems. These systems can involve various techniques and models, including but not limited to causal language modeling. The primary goal of OASST is to develop high-quality, open, and accessible conversational agents that can interact with users in natural and helpful ways.
So, while OASST might employ causal language modeling as one of its methods, it encompasses a wider range of technologies and goals aimed at building comprehensive conversational AI.

## Get to know Instruction Dataset

### Use the Hugging Face datasets library to load and save a dataset.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("tatsu-lab/alpaca")
dataset.save_to_disk("Dataset")
```

* Import the load_dataset function from the datasets library.
* Load the "alpaca" dataset from the "tatsu-lab" repository on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca). The alpaca dataset is a collection of instruction-following data used for training language models.
* Save the loaded dataset to a local directory named "Dataset".

|File|Description|
|-|-|
|Dataset\dataset_dict.json|It contains metadata about the dataset, including information about its structure and the different splits (if any).|
|Dataset\train|It is a directory that contains the training split of the dataset. The Alpaca dataset appears to have only a training split.|
|Dataset\train\data-00000-of-00001.arrow|It is an Arrow file containing the actual data of the training split. Arrow is a columnar memory format designed for efficient data processing and interchange.|
|Dataset\train\dataset_info.json|It contains detailed information about the dataset, such as its description, citation, and features.|
|Dataset\train\state.json|It keeps track of the state of the dataset, which can be useful for caching and version control.|

### Convert Dataset to a single Instruction-Output (Prompt-Completion) format JSON file

```python
import json
from datasets import load_from_disk

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_from_disk("D:/cmp/GetDataSet/Dataset")

# Function to convert a single example to alpaca without input format
def to_alpaca_no_input_format(example):
    return {
        "instruction": example["instruction"],
        "output": example["output"]
    }

# Convert the entire dataset to alpaca without input format
_alpaca_no_inpu_data = [to_alpaca_no_input_format(example) for example in dataset["train"]]

# Save as a single JSON file
with open("alpaca_no_input.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    json.dump(_alpaca_no_inpu_data, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)

print(f"Saved {len(_alpaca_no_inpu_data)} examples to alpaca_no_input.json")

# Save the original dataset to another JSON file
output_file_original = "original_dataset.json"
with open(output_file_original, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    original_data = [example for example in dataset["train"]]
    json.dump(original_data, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)

print(f"Saved original dataset to {output_file_original}")
```

When using or referring to this format, it's often helpful to briefly describe its structure (i.e., a JSON list of objects, each with "instruction" and "output" fields) to avoid any potential confusion.

|Useage example|Description|
|-|-|
|OpenAI's GPT models|They use a similar format for their fine-tuning datasets, often referred to as "prompt-completion pairs".|
|InstructGPT|This was one of the early adopters of instruction-tuning, using a similar format.|
|Stanford Alpaca|The original Alpaca dataset used a format very close to "Instruction-Output", though it included an additional "input" field (which could be empty).|
|FLAN (Fine-tuned Language Net)|While FLAN uses a more complex format internally, many of its tasks can be represented in this instruction-output format.|

### Instruction-Output (Prompt-Completion) format JSON file example

```plaintext
[
  {
    "instruction": "Give three tips for staying healthy.",
    "output": "1.Eat a balanced diet and make sure to include plenty of fruits and vegetables. \n2. Exercise regularly to keep your body active and strong. \n3. Get enough sleep and maintain a consistent sleep schedule."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What are the three primary colors?",
    "output": "The three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Describe the structure of an atom.",
    "output": "An atom is made up of a nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons that travel in orbits around the nucleus. The protons and neutrons have a positive charge, while the electrons have a negative charge, resulting in an overall neutral atom. The number of each particle determines the atomic number and the type of atom."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How can we reduce air pollution?",
    "output": "There are a number of ways to reduce air pollution, such as shifting to renewable energy sources, encouraging the use of public transportation, prohibiting the burning of fossil fuels, implementing policies to reduce emissions from industrial sources, and implementing vehicle emissions standards. Additionally, individuals can do their part to reduce air pollution by reducing car use, avoiding burning materials such as wood, and changing to energy efficient appliances."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Describe a time when you had to make a difficult decision.",
    "output": "I had to make a difficult decision when I was working as a project manager at a construction company. I was in charge of a project that needed to be completed by a certain date in order to meet the client’s expectations. However, due to unexpected delays, we were not able to meet the deadline and so I had to make a difficult decision. I decided to extend the deadline, but I had to stretch the team’s resources even further and increase the budget. Although it was a risky decision, I ultimately decided to go ahead with it to ensure that the project was completed on time and that the client’s expectations were met. The project was eventually successfully completed and this was seen as a testament to my leadership and decision-making abilities."
