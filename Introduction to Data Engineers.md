# Introduction to Data Engineers

## What is a Data Engineer?

* In recent years, the role of a data engineer has become extremely popular, particularly due to the rise of big data. Simply put, the primary job of a data engineer is to provide usable data to data users, which may include data analysts, data scientists, and various business units within the company such as the marketing department, HR department, etc.
* Data engineers come from diverse backgrounds, including computer science, statistics, and even other industries. The key is their understanding of data and engineering.
* Data engineers need to master various tools, including cloud services (GCP, AWS, Azure), distributed systems, container technology, scheduling tools, and streaming processing systems.

### The Role of Data Engineers in a Team

* Data engineers are responsible for organizing and providing data to other roles within the data team, such as data analysts and data scientists. Data analysts explore surface information and trends from the data, while data scientists delve deeper to uncover hidden values and make predictions.
